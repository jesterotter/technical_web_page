      <p>The deal: each player is dealt five cards, leaving four which make up the "kitty". The top card of the kitty is flipped over.
      </p>
      <p>The bidding/making trump: starting left of the dealer, each player decides whether or not they want the suit of the flipped card to be trump. If they do, they "order up" the dealer by saying "pick it up". The dealer then puts the flipped card into her hand, and discards one card. If all players pass, then the same process is repeated with each player able to name any suit as trump, except for that which was turned down in the first round. When a player makes trump, they may decide to "go alone", meaning that their partner sits out that round and they play against both of their opponents by themself to attempt to secure extra points.</p>

      <h1 id="start">Getting started</h1>
      <p>To play euchre, you need a deck of cards. Or rather, you need half a deck of cards (9 - Ace). You also need four players. It's best if at least two of them already know how to play, and so can teach the beginners (who they will take as partners). Variations of the game for 3 players, 2 players, and 6 players are also relatively common.
      </p>
      <p>Euchre is played with cards 9 through Ace of every suit. So remove the 2's through 8's and set them aside. From this group, take out the fives. These are used to count points.
        Determine who the teams will be. Obviously, the better your partner, the better your chances of winning. Also, winning together can build camaraderie. However, it is also worth bearing in mind that, although your opponents are your opponents, a bungling partner attracts the most anger. If you are just starting out, pick someone you are not afraid of disappointing.
        </p>
        <p>Decide who deals: this is usually done by flipping over cards in front of each player. The first one to receive a bower (jack) deals.
          </p>
          <p>Deal five cards to each player. The card after the last card dealt is flipped over and the first round of bidding determines whether it shall be trump. 
          </p>

      <h1 id="play">The play</h1>
      <p>The player to the left of the dealer leads. Other players must, if they can, follow suit (play the same suit as the card led). If they have no cards of that suit, they can play another. Trumps beat other suits. The player who plays the highest card takes the trick. When a team wins three tricks, they've won the hand. If that is the team that chose trump, then they get one point. If the other team made trump, then the winning team has "euchred" their opponents, and win two points. If a team wins all of the tricks, this is called a "march" and is worth two points. If a player "goes alone" and wins all the tricks, they get four points. The game ends at ten.
      </p>
      <p>Another important but weird rule in euchre is that when trump is made, the jack of that suit becomes the highest card, and is called the "right bower". The jack of the suit of the same color is transmogrified by the idiosyncratic rules of the game into a trump, and is named "the left bower". It is the second-highest card. So, if spades trump, then the Jack of Clubs becomes the second-highest spade. This is easy to forget because, to beginner's eyes, the Jack of Clubs will still look like a club. Make no mistake. It is a spade.

      <h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
      <ul>
      <li>DO NOT forget that the left bower is trump: the jack of the same color as the jack of trump (the right bower) is trump. Beginners forget this, leading them to misplay and to frustrate their partners.</>
      <li>DO NOT trump your partner's ace: the ace of any suit (except trump) is usually a winning card. To trump your partner's ace is to waste a trump on a trick that your partner was likely to win anyway.
      </li>
      <li>DO NOT forget how only the dealer can be "ordered up". In the first round of calling trump, only the dealer is allowed to pick up the card under consideration. Other players may "order up" the dealer, making that suit trump and compelling the dealer to put the card in his hand. However, they may not pick up the card themselves. If you are a beginner, you will forget this and try to pick it up yourself. Then you'll start to doubt whether you wanted that to be trump in the first place. People will let you off the first time. After that, be careful.
      </li>
      <li>DO NOT order up your partner if you do not want to "go alone". In the first round of bidding, you have the option of ordering up your partner. However, according to Canadian rules, any player who orders up their partner must play alone.</li>
      <li>DO NOT "table talk". Even sighs or frowns can be considered hints to tip your partner off to what cards are in your hand. This is taken so seriously that beyond being forbidden, it's a misstep that will earn you disrespect.</li>
    </ul>

      <h1 id="tips">Tips</h1>
      <ul>
      <li>DO lead trump if you are on the team that called trump. This is just a rule of thumb, but it can get you started. If your opponents made trump, don't lead trump. 
      </li>
      <li>DO call trump if you think you can win.
      </li>
      <li>DO count on your partner for one trick. You don't know what they have in their hand, but you can generally assume they'll be able to take one trick.</li>
      <li>DO sow discord in the opposing team: partnerships without trust don't win. If one of your opponents messes up, be sure their partner notices.
