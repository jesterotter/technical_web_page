2. Within the nav element, add one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical web page.
3. Add a main element with a corresponding `id="main_doc"` to contain the page's main content.
4. Within the `main_doc` element, add a minimum of five section elements, each with a class of `main_sec`. 
5. The first element within each `.main_sec` should have a header element, describing the topic of that section.
6. Each section element with the class of `main_sec` should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header. For example `"html and html5"` should look like (`id="html_and_html5"`)
7. The `.main_sec` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each)
8. The `.main_sec` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each)
9. The `.main_sec` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each)
10. Additionally, the navbar should contain links, also known as, a elements with the `class="nav_link"`. There should be one for every element within the `class="main_sec"`.
11. Each element with the `class="nav_link"` should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section.
12. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `main_doc` element.
13. Use a media query to set elements `id="navbar"` fixed on the screen's left or right side only when viewed on larger devices like laptops.
